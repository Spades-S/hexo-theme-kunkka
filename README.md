## Features

#### SNS Label

Syntax:
```plain
{% sns [icon] [text] [url] %}
```
`icon` must exist in [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). The third argument `url` is optional, it will make the whole element clickable.

You can use this in your posts and pages.

#### Search page

We have an isolated page for displaying search results. Our search engine is [A jQuery-based Local Search Engine for Hexo](http://hahack.com/codes/local-search-engine-for-hexo/). To use this, install dependency first:

```bash
npm install hexo-generator-search --save
```

then set `search` in theme config to true.

#### Footnote

To use footnote, you have to switch your markdown renderer to `hexo-renderer-markdown-it`, and enable the `markdown-it-footnote` plugin first.

We have made a special style for footnotes, just for you to enjoy.

#### Separated widgets

HTML contents of widgets are generated inside `[path_to_site]/public/componets` folder, especially the `recent_posts` widget. They're loaded dynamically using jQuery. Thanks to this, there's no need to generate all posts over and over on single post modification.
